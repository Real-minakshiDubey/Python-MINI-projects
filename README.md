# Python Mini Projects 🐍

A collection of beginner-friendly Python projects built to practice core programming concepts like conditionals, loops, functions, file handling, and basic user interaction via the console.

These projects are ideal for absolute beginners and cover real-world logic in a simple way. No external libraries required.

It covers dataset loading, data cleaning, filtering, grouping, sorting, and basic analysis.

## 🧠 Topics Covered
- Reading CSV files (`pd.read_csv`)
- Viewing data (`head`, `tail`, `info`, `describe`)
- Selecting rows & columns (`loc`, `iloc`)
- Filtering with conditions
- Sorting data (`sort_values`)
- Adding & modifying columns
- Grouping & aggregations (`groupby`, `mean`, `sum`, `count`)
- Handling missing values (`fillna`, `dropna`)
- Exporting datasets (`to_csv`)
